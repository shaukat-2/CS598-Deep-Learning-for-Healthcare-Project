## Data Download & Processing

1. Download MIMIC-III Data Set from physionet website after requesting access and acquiring access.
2. Use main [MIMIC Github Repository](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code/tree/main/mimic-iii/benchmark) to load the downloaded .csvs to postgres. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rg1p7sg2Qo) is very helpful in installation of postgres and building MIMIC Demo Dataset and can be used for whole as well.
